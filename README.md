# Amazon Web Scraper and Price Tracker

This Python script scrapes the title and price of a specific Amazon product and tracks changes over time. If the price drops below a certain threshold, it sends an email notification.

## Features

- Scrapes the Amazon product page for title and price information.
- Stores the scraped data (title, price, and date) in a CSV file (`AmazonWebScraperDataset.csv`).
- Checks the price daily and updates the CSV file.
- Sends an email notification if the price drops below $20 (adjustable threshold).

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries (`beautifulsoup4`, `requests`, `smtplib`, `datetime`, `time`, `csv`, `pandas`)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/amazon-web-scraper.git
   cd amazon-web-scraper
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Replace the `URL` variable in the script (`amazon_scraper.py`) with your desired Amazon product URL.
2. Update the `sender_email` and `password` variables in the `send_mail` function with your Gmail credentials.
3. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python amazon_scraper.py
   ```

4. The script will scrape the product page, update `AmazonWebScraperDataset.csv`, and send an email if the price drops below the specified threshold.
